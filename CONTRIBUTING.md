# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are very welcome! :pray:

Fork the repo, do your things and create a pull request to **develop** branch. And check that all the tests are green :)

**Note**:
This Contributing stuff is in wip, I will add more things as soon as possible.

## Adding or updating a functionality

Please open an issue with your idea and we'll discuss together ;)
